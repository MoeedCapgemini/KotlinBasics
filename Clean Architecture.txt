Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that focuses on separating the concerns of an application to make it easier to maintain, test, and scale.

In the context of Android Kotlin development, Clean Architecture provides a structured approach to organize code in a way that isolates different concerns, 
such as user interface (UI), business logic, and data management.  

Key Principles of Clean Architecture
1.Separation of Concerns: Each layer of the architecture should have a specific role and should not depend on other layers unnecessarily.
  This promotes loose coupling and high cohesion.

2.Dependency Inversion: The core of the application (business logic) should not depend on external details (e.g., databases, frameworks). 
  Instead, the external details should depend on the core logic, which can be achieved using interfaces and abstract classes.

3.Testability: Since different parts of the application are isolated from each other, it's much easier to write unit tests for each layer independently.

4.Maintainability and Scalability: As the app grows, adding new features or changing existing ones becomes easier because the architecture 
  provides clear boundaries between different layers. 

Layers of Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture typically consists of four layers, each with a specific responsibility:

1. Entities (Domain Layer):
   This is the innermost layer and contains business models (entities) that represent the core of the application. They don't depend on any other layer.
   These entities should contain business logic that is independent of frameworks, databases, or UI. 

2. Use Cases (Domain Layer):
   This layer holds the application business rules. It contains the use case or interaction logic (i.e., specific actions that the app performs).
   It represents how the entities interact and are processed. For example, if your app has a feature to "fetch user details," that use case logic would be here.

3. Interface Adapters (Presentation/Adapter Layer):
   This layer adapts data from the use cases into a format that the UI can consume, and vice versa.
   It contains presenters, view models, and controllers in an Android application, as well as the repositories that interact with the data layer.
   It's where the UI components (activities, fragments, views) are located. 
     These components should only depend on the use cases and not directly on the entities.
4. Frameworks and Drivers (Data Layer):
   This is the outermost layer, where frameworks and external dependencies like databases, networking, and third-party libraries live.
   It contains the actual implementation of repositories, APIs, databases, and other system services.

Core Concepts in Android Kotlin with Clean Architecture:
Repositories:
Repositories sit between the domain and data layers. They are used to fetch data, either from a network, database, or other external sources.
 In Clean Architecture, a repository is an interface in the domain layer, and its implementation resides in the data layer.

ViewModels:
In Android, the ViewModel (in the presentation layer) is used to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. 
It interacts with use cases (from the domain layer) and prepares the data for the UI.

Use Cases:
A use case is a specific action that a user might perform in the app, such as "fetch data," "save user profile," etc. 
The use cases orchestrate the flow of data between the UI and the business logic (entities).


Dependency Injection:
Dependency Injection (DI) is a key part of Clean Architecture. It helps manage dependencies between the layers of the architecture in a decoupled way. 
DI frameworks like Dagger or Koin are often used to inject dependencies into different parts of the app, such as ViewModels, repositories, or use cases.


Advantages of Clean Architecture in Android with Kotlin:
Decoupling: By separating the app into clear layers, itâ€™s easier to replace or modify parts of the app without affecting other areas.
Testability: With isolated layers, unit testing each part of the app (e.g., use cases, repositories, ViewModels) is easier.
Maintainability: A well-organized codebase makes it easier to onboard new developers and makes long-term maintenance simpler.
Flexibility: You can easily switch or upgrade external dependencies (e.g., switch a database implementation or replace a network library) 
without affecting the core business logic.


Domain Layer - Use Case

interface GetUserDetailsUseCase {
    suspend fun execute(userId: String): User
}

class GetUserDetailsUseCaseImpl(private val userRepository: UserRepository) : GetUserDetailsUseCase {
    override suspend fun execute(userId: String): User {
        return userRepository.getUserDetails(userId)
    }
}



Data Layer - Repository Implementation

class UserRepositoryImpl(private val apiService: ApiService) : UserRepository {
    override suspend fun getUserDetails(userId: String): User {
        // Fetch user details from an API
        return apiService.getUserDetails(userId)
    }
}
