Firebase Crashlytics primarily focuses on crashes and fatal issues in your app but it can also detect non-fatal issues 
(such as exceptions or errors) that you can log and track manually

Automatically Detected: Firebase Crashlytics is designed to automatically detect and report crashes in your app.
 Crashes occur when your app encounters an unhandled exception, causing it to terminate unexpectedly.

Enable Crashlytics in Your Application: Firebase Crashlytics will automatically be initialized when you integrate it, 
but you can also log custom exceptions or non-fatal errors explicitly in your app:

Detailed Crash Reports: When a crash occurs, Crashlytics will log a detailed report, including stack traces, 
device info (OS version, model, etc.), app version, and even the number of users affected. 
This helps developers understand why and where the crash happened.

2. Non-Fatal Issues (Custom Errors and Exceptions):
   Manually Logged Issues: While Firebase Crashlytics doesn't automatically track every issue
   (like warnings or handled exceptions), 
   it allows you to log custom non-fatal issues (exceptions or custom messages) to help you monitor app behavior.

Custom Event Logging: You can use Firebase Crashlytics to track non-crash issues, 
                      like specific exceptions, handled errors, or abnormal behavior that doesn't result in a crash.
