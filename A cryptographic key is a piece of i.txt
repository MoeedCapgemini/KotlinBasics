A cryptographic key is a piece of informationâ€”usually a string of bitsâ€”that is used in cryptographic algorithms to:

Encrypt data (turn it into unreadable form)
Decrypt data (turn it back into readable form)
Sign data (prove who sent it)
Verify signatures (check authenticity)
There are two main types:

Symmetric keys â€“ The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric keys â€“ A pair of keys is used: a public key (shared with others) and a private key (kept secret).

Types of Cryptographic Keys
Symmetric Keys â€“ Same key is used for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
Asymmetric Keys â€“ A key pair is used: one public and one private (e.g., RSA, EC).

Symmetric Key (AES-256) â€“ 256-bit key (32 bytes):
Asymmetric Key Pair (RSA)

The Android Keystore provides a container to hold cryptographic keys in a secure manner. Keys stored in the Keystore are non-exportable, meaning they cannot be extracted from the device.

Common Use Cases
Encrypting sensitive data (e.g., user credentials)
Signing data (e.g., JWT tokens)
Verifying digital signatures
Secure communication (e.g., TLS)

The Android Keystore is a secure system provided by Android that allows apps to store cryptographic keys in a way that makes them hard to extract, even if the device is compromised.

 Why Use Keystore?
Security: Keys are stored in a secure hardware-backed area (if available).
Isolation: Apps canâ€™t access each otherâ€™s keys.
No manual key management: Android handles key storage and protection.


ðŸ”’ Real-World Use Cases
Securely encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens).
Implement biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint unlock).
Protect app secrets without storing them in plain text.

Use Keystore when you need full control over encryption, signing, or working with files or custom data.
Use EncryptedSharedPreferences when you want a simple and secure way to store small key-value data.



1. What is Android Keystore and why is it used?
Answer:
Android Keystore is a system that allows you to securely generate, store, and use cryptographic keys. It ensures that keys are stored in a secure container and are not accessible outside the Keystore.

Use Case: Encrypting sensitive data like passwords, tokens, or using biometric authentication.

What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in Keystore?
Answer:

Symmetric: Same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
Asymmetric: Public key encrypts, private key decrypts (e.g., RSA).
Use Case:

Use AES for fast, local encryption.
Use RSA for secure key exchange or digital signatures.


What encryption does EncryptedSharedPreferences use?
Answer:

Key Encryption: AES-256 SIV
Value Encryption: AES-256 GCM
Uses MasterKey stored in Android Keystore.
